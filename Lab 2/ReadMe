I went in on Monday to complete the lab and got as far as the reading the five longest sentences in the work. In class, I tried to get the updated version of the text, but when I did that, it did something strange to all of my work. Functions that I'd defined were weird and I closed the program to reload it to my last save point on Monday. When I re-opened it, all of my work was gone. I knew we were going to work on some stuff in class, so I hadn't pushed the lab to git.
