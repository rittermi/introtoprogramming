Please see sketchgo for the completed(ish) lab and the other for the variety of mistakes and thought processes for the work.
This assignment had a struggle beyond the typical programming struggles.
The directions were a little confusing. I wasn't sure if I was supposed to be doing each part of the lab on a different file, or all in one.
Some of the directions in the tutorial were out of date, and every time we re used the draw function, it would only do the last defined code.
As a result, there are two pages, since I split the difference on whether this was supposed to be one or five documents.
The thought process I used can be found throughout the code and I tried to label the exercises as best I could.
Again, I'm so sorry you have to look at this.
