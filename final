# Silk Road Ren'py
#Summary
# I hope to create and online visual novel outlining the journey of a merchant/item on the silk Road
# I want to give this project to my former coworkers so that they can give it to students as a way for students to have a visual and interactive account of the history of the Silk Road.
# Ideally, they can use it as an interactive and engaging teaching aid.
